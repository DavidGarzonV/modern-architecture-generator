# DISCLAIMER

The software architectures presented in this project are proposals based on research, experiences, and specific considerations. These definitions are a starting point, a reference framework that seeks to stimulate discussion and innovation in the field of software architecture.

It is important to emphasize that software architectures are dynamic and evolving constructions. The presented solutions are not definitive or the only possible ones, but rather an invitation to explore and adapt concepts to the specific needs of each project.

The nature of open-source software fosters collaboration and continuous improvement. All contributors are encouraged to study, modify, and extend these architectures, as long as the principles of free software are respected.

Remember that:

- Architecture is a process, not an end product. Needs and technologies change constantly, so architectures must be able to evolve.
- There is no perfect architecture for all problems. The choice of an architecture depends on factors such as the project context, non-functional requirements, and the preferences of the development team.
- The community is the key. The exchange of ideas and experiences within the developer community is fundamental to enriching and improving software architectures.
